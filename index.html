        ðŸ‘‰ C.V. RAMAN, in full <b> Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman </b> was born on November 7,1888 in Tiruchirappalli, Madras, India. <br>
        ðŸ‘‰His father, initially a school teacher, became a lecturer in mathematics and physics in a college in Vishakhapatnam. <br>
        ðŸ‘‰Raman studied in St. Aloysius Anglo-Indian High School at Vishakapatnam. He was a brilliant student and passed his matriculation examination when he was just 11. At the age of 13 he passed his F.A. examination (equivalent to todayâ€™s intermediate examination) with a scholarship. <br>
        ðŸ‘‰He joined the Presidency College in Madras in 1902 and received his B.A. in physics in 1904. He topped the exams and won a gold medal. Three years later, he earned his M.A. degree in 1907. <br>
        ðŸ‘‰ He displayed a brilliant mind even as a child and passed his matriculation examination at a much younger age as compared to other students. <br>
        ðŸ‘‰Though he was deeply interested in science, he appeared for the Financial Civil Service (FCS) examination at the insistence of his father. He topped the examination and went to Calcutta in 1907 to join the Indian Finance Department as Assistant Accountant General. <br>
        ðŸ‘‰Still his heart was in scientific research and he began conducting research at the Indian Association for Cultivation of Sciences during his free time. His job was very hectic, yet he was so dedicated towards science that he often spent nights at research. <br>
        ðŸ‘‰Even though the facilities available at the association were very limited, it did not deter Raman at all who went on to publish his findings in leading international journals like â€˜Natureâ€™, â€˜The Philosophical Magazineâ€™, and â€˜Physics Reviewâ€™. During this time, his research was basically in the areas of vibrations and acoustics. <br>
        ðŸ‘‰In 1948 he established the Raman Research Institute (RRI) in Bangalore for conducting scientific research in different fields of physics. He continued with his research in the institute till his death. <br>
        ðŸ‘‰He won the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the Raman Effect", becoming the first Indian to win a Nobel Prize in the sciences. <br>
        ðŸ‘‰He was honored with the Bharat Ratna, Indiaâ€™s highest civilian award, in 1954 in recognition of his invaluable contributions to the field of science. <br>
        ðŸ‘‰He is best known for discovering the â€˜Raman Effectâ€™, or the inelastic scattering of a photon. He showed through experimentation that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the deflected light changes in wavelength. This was a ground breaking discovery in early 20th century physics. <br>
        ðŸ‘‰He married Lokasundari Ammal in 1907 and had two sons with herâ€”Chandrasekhar and Radhakrishnan. <br>
        ðŸ‘‰He lived a long and productive life and was active till the very end. He died in 1970 at the age of 82. <br>
        ðŸ‘‰This great scientist was the paternal uncle of another excellent scientist and Nobel laureate, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.
